# üåê Networking Fundamentals ‚Äî Study Notes

This repository contains structured notes from my study of core networking concepts, protocols, and configurations. This foundational knowledge is essential for deeper understanding in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and systems administration.

## üß† Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Network Layers (OSI & TCP/IP Models)
- **OSI Model (7 Layers)**: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical
- **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access
- Each layer has specific responsibilities in data encapsulation and transmission.

### 2. Switch and End Device Configuration
- Basic configuration of **Layer 2 switches** and **PCs** via CLI.
- Assigning IP addresses to devices.
- Verifying connectivity with `ping`.

### 3. Protocols and Models
- Protocols studied: **TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ARP**
- Understanding how protocols interact across layers.
- Concept of **protocol data units (PDUs)**.

### 4. Number Systems
- Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal conversions.
- Understanding how IP addressing and subnetting are based on binary.

### 5. Ethernet Switching
- MAC address table, frame forwarding, and filtering.
- **Switching methods**: Store-and-forward vs Cut-through.
- Collision domains and broadcast domains.

### 6. Address Resolution
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** to map IP to MAC.
- Difference between ARP and DNS.

### 7. Router Configuration
- Basic routing concepts.
- Static IP routing configuration via CLI.
- Enabling interfaces and assigning IP addresses.
- Using `show` and `ping` to verify routing.

### 8. IPv4 Addressing
- Structure: Network + Host.
- Public vs Private ranges.
- Subnet masks, CIDR notation.
- Manual IP addressing and subnetting examples.

### 9. IPv6 Addressing
- Address structure and abbreviations.
- Types: Global Unicast, Link-Local, Loopback.
- Stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC).

### 10. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- Role in diagnostics (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`).
- Echo requests/replies for connectivity checks.
- ICMP vs TCP/UDP behavior.
